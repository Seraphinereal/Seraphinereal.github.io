        The Fell Gob
        </h1>

        <div class="font1" style="color:#eac8f5";><p>-=-   -=Game Synopsis=-   -=-</p>
            <p>You play as Gobby, a goblin in the depths of a cave. The goal is to use special tools
            and abilities to make it through the cave upwards until you escape the cave and get a
            treasure chest. Most of the abilities are standard in platformers but presented
            in creative ways. The lore is something like a rags to riches story of Gobby
            which is expanded upon in future games.</p>

            <p>The Fell Gob was the first game I was apart of, back in early February 2024.
            I developed the game alongside a team of 3 classmates. We shared the workload
            codewise and it served as my first experience with Lua.</p>

            <img src="/images/gobby.png" height="50" alt="Image of Gobby" title="Gobby">

            <p>The image above is a character we (I) created for The Fell Gob named Gobby. Gobby
            has since become a staple reference in the majority of our projects since then.</p>

            <p>This project was my first step into programming, it was a small step though so
            there isn't much worth writing about. It taught me a good grasp of what game
            development looks like and it set a nice baseline to improve from in the future.</p>
