            <div class="font1" style="color:#eac8f5";><p>-=-   -=Game Synopsis=-   -=-</p>
                <p>Augment Spirit is a fighting game, except you can only play as one character
                and you can only fight a training dummy. Through the use of punching, kicking,
                a ranged blast attack, and an AOE stomp attack you lower the health of the
                training dummy until it hits zero and subsequently heals back to full. The game
                features a menu and character selection screen that can be navigated, but only
                'Raging Demon' can be chosen.</p>

                <img src="/images/RagingDemonLogo.png" height="64" alt="Character Icon for Raging Demon" title="Character Icon for Raging Demon">
                <p>Raging Demon is the first character, a demon brawler that utilizes rage like
                a magical force to dominate the enemy.<br></p>

                <p>'Blue Character' was going to be the second character, name ideas I thought of were
                'Ice Ronin,' or 'The Frozen Sword.' A refined swordswoman wielding a sword
                that emits a lethal chill.<br></p>

                <p>Abyssal Wretch was my third, final, and favourite character planned. The idea was
                the Abyssal Wretch is a kraken attempting to maintain a human form through magic but
                is barely keeping it together. The attacks would've been revolving around its human limbs
                bursting out into massive tentacles for huge slow and heavy hits. I am very likely
                going to revisit this concept for a future game.<br></p>

                <p>The idea was to first pick player 1, and then pick player 2, and it would be optional to
                pick the training dummy as the player 2.<br></p>

                <p>If there was more than one character to choose, choosing this would've randomized which character
                you would play as.

                <p>Going into this project I was super excited to finally have a solo project
                I could pour my heart and soul into, however I made massive mistakes that would
                ripple for months and teach me a very important lesson. I spent over 2 months on this
                project instead of the intended 2 or 3 weeks. This is because I spent more time
                making and animating sprites the best I could, and was way too ambiitous considering
                we were developing our projects without any game engine and using C++. I learned
                to set realistic goals, I am a programmer not an artist, and its okay to if a project
                is ugly so long as it is feature complete.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This project had me fall behind enough that I had to temporarily skip our final C++
                project to make the game 'Rekindle' in Unity with my previous group from Lua and Love2D.
                I will likely need to sacrifice my christmas break to go back and make a third C++ project.
                I entered Augment Spirit naive, and left it with valuable life lessons and thoroughly humbled.
                <br><br>
                One last note, the majority of the sprites I worked on I am not showing here. They
                aren't even all that good.</p>
