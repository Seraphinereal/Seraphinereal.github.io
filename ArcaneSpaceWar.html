                <p>You play as the 'Basement Wizard' from my Love2D game Arcane Undercroft,
                except now piloting a spaceship. Gobbies continuously spawn and move along the top
                of the screen shooting space bullets at the wizard, and asteroids fly past from
                the left and ride sides of the screen. You fight back through the use of fire
                and ice spells, stunning enemies with ice to stop them from moving and fighting
                back, then blasting everything away with fire. The goal is to accumulate a highscore
                and survive as long as possible. Arcane Space War is a bullet hell game.</p>

                <p>Arcane Space War is my second solo game in Unity, I made it start to finish in
                a week and a half, I worked tirelessly all day everyday because I was determined
                to have enough spare time to implement a talent card system and new obtainable spells.
                Unfortunately We were told we had possibly just 5 days to update our portfolios and resumes
                for field placement applications, so I had to stop development early and switch my
                priorities to write this right now. If I had the time to, I was going to add
                a gravity spell that changed the trajectory of asteroids to hit enemy ships as
                an obtainable talent card.</p>

                <p>Everyone in my original group from working on Arcane Undercroft and Fell Gob
                has made several games revolving around the lineages and history of these two
                characters, so since I created the characters I thought it was about time for
                me to make my own continuation. I had a lot of fun working on this project,
                I'm happy enough with it to look into how to put it on itch.io as my first public
                project, when I have the spare time to do that of course.<br></p>
